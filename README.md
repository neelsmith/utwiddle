# `utwiddle`: ubiquitous URN twiddling

`utwiddle` (pronounced "you twiddle") is a domain-specific language for working with citable scholarly resources.  This repository includes an `sbt` build file making scala libraries implementing `utwiddle` available to your environment.

To work with the libraries interactively, run `sbt console`, and within the console, `:load imports.sc`

The file `demo.sc` has a few examples of usage of the libraries.

Documentation (like the utwiddle language itself) is in active development.
