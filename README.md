The SBT build file makes scala libraries for work in the CITE architecture available to your environment.  `imports.sc` is a scala  snippet importing current versions of those libraries.  To work with the CITE archicture interactively, run `sbt console`, and within the console, `:load imports.sc`

The file `demo.sc` has a few examples of usage of the libraries.
