`utwiddle` (pronounced "you twiddle") is a domain-specific language for working with citable scholarly resources.

It is under active development. Some of the individual, underlying libraries are already reasonably mature (e.g., the `xcite` library, used in utwiddle for URN matching of pairs of CTS URNs or CITE2 URNs), but the overall framework is still far from a release version.  Stay tuned for updates.
